# Block-Programming-Fonts
##Introduction
MicroBlock is a **very** tiny monospaced programming font who's main design feature is to work in modern IDE's with a crisp clean and readable look (while still being, _very_, **_very_** small).

The pixel width of each glyph is just 4 pixels wide per character with one blank column totalling only 5 pixels wide and no glyph has a height greater than 10 pixels making a charming 2:1 height to width ratio.

It's design is of a small bitmaped square font, except wherever possible the North-West and South-East corners of each glyph are truncated at 45 degree angles that leaves a very natrual - human - looking font that has easily distinguished lettering. 

A notable feature is that the "Italic" version is not actually slanted, rather it is a completely square font.  The purpose of Italics in the perview of moder IDE's is to identify certain types of code, so it needs only to be distinguashable from the Regular version of the font.  That was the reasoning for this anyways, feedback is welcome.

I created this font out of a need and desire to have this small size while retaining the features I value as most important in a good programming font.  The featrues include the following:


	Clearly distinguashable bracketing () {} []

	In MicroBlok the bracketing glyphs are larger in combined height and descent of all apha-numerical glyphs.

    Easy differentiation between commonly mixed up glyphs: 1, l, i, and I or o, O, and 0 for example.  Each is very unique.
    
    The numbers are both emboldened and raised one pixel above the alphabetical glyphs to make them very easy to identify.
    
    To accomodate easy to read, non-ugly, bold lettering that will fit in the alloted space an outline of the font is used.
