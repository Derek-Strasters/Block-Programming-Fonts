# Block-Programming-Fonts
MicroBlock is a **very** tiny monospaced programming font who's main design feature is to work in modern IDE's with a crisp clean and readable look (while still being, _very_, **_very_** small).

The pixel width of each glyph is just 4 pixels wide per character with one blank column totalling only 5 pixels wide and no glyph has a height greater than 10 pixels making a charming 2:1 height to width ratio.

I created this font out of a need and desire to have this small size while retaining the features I value as most important in a good programming font.  The featrues include the following:
Clearly distinguashable bracketing () {} [] 
	In MicroBlok the bracketing glyphs are larger in combined height and descent of all apha-numerical glyphs
